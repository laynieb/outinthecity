                <p class="about-p">With so many places to shop in NYC, here's some must visits in the city. <br><a href="https://www.bloomingdales.com/" target="_blank">Bloomingdale's</a>: The 59th street location is the iconic flaghip store. This location is definitely not for the faint of heart as there's every single department you can imagine from cutting edge brands like The Kooples to home brands like Cuisanart.<br><a href="https://www.c21stores.com/" target="_blank">Century 21</a>: Looking for extreme discounts on designerware? Look no more. Century 21 is were you want to go. WARNING- If you are used to organized sections, this may not be the store for you as this store is the definition of rummage shopping. However, there's no satisfaction like getting a deep discount on Versace!</p>
