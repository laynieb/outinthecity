                <p class="about-p">Ramen has been all the rage the past few years and this trend will not be going away anytime soon. Ippudo is a must if you are visiting the city. Be warned: the wait can be terribly long in the original location in East Village. Insider tip: Get there about an hour and a half early to put your name down, and then explore the uniqueness of that neighborhood while you wait and trust me the food is worth the wait. The most popular bowl is the Akumara ramen which comes in a silky broth and al dente thin noodles. This dining experience would not be complete without ordering the pork buns which melt in your mouth. Dont' eat pork? No problem, they also serve chicken buns which are just as tasty.
