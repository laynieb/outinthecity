                <p class="about-p">Another hit out of the ballpark for the Marvel films! The third installment of the Thor films has our leading man show off his comedic chops. Although there's no love interest, Thor's new gang of misfits makes this film highly entertaining. Loki, always the scene stealer, proves he's just as much a leading man as Thor. If you are looking for an action film, be sure to watch Thor: Ragnorak!</p>
